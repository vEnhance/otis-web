    Normally, secret units are automatically added to your
    curriculum once you have reached a sufficiently high level,
    at a difficulty chosen based on your other units.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use this form to manually request a secret unit if this
    didn't happen or if you want a different difficulty level.
    This won't unlock the unit, but it'll make it visible so you
    can submit a unit petition to unlock it or
    indicate it as the next unlock of a submitted unit.
