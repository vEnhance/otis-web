<h3>Market Rules</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Markets open every Friday at midnight Eastern time,
		and close at the next Monday at 6am Eastern time.</li>
	<li>Each market has a correct answer $A \in [10^{-6}, 10^6]$.
		The value of $A$ may be rounded arbitrarily by the game master.
		The precision will not exceed $6$ decimal places.
	</li>
	<li>The guess $B$ you submit must be a real number in the interval $[10^{-6}, 10^6]$.
		Guesses will be rounded to $6$ decimal places.</li>
	<li>In a standard market,
		if you submit a guess $B$, your score for the market (in â™ )
		is given by the function
		\[ w \cdot \left(\min\left\{\frac AB, \frac BA\right\}\right)^\alpha \]
		where $w$ and $\alpha$ are two fixed parameters announced for the market.
		(The default values are $w=4$ and $\alpha=2$.)
		Some markets may have other rules.
	</li>
	<li>You may only submit one guess. It is not possible to change your guess later.</li>
	<li>Discussion, collusion, and other antics are permitted.</li>
</ol>
