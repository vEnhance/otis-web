  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>After joining above, you should be able to submit problems and testsolve proposals.</p>
  <h3>Proposing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use "Add Problem" once you're in the Probase collection.</li>
    <li>
      Please make sure to provide a full solution and triple-check your answer
      for accuracy to avoid frustration for the testsolvers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please use a <strong>descriptive title</strong> that doesn't
      spoil the problem but gives an idea for what the problem is about.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Solving</h3>
  <p>
    There are five tiers of difficulty, and testsolvers get an amount of
    time per problem when testsolving it based on the tier:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AIME 1-3: Solvers get 10 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 4-6: Solvers get 15 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 7-9: Solvers get 20 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 10-12: Solvers get 25 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 13-15: Solvers get 30 minutes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After you solve or give up on a proposal, you can read spoilers and comment
    on the thread for the problem. You can also upvote the problem using the heart
    icon to indicate that you like it.
  </p>
