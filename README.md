# OTIS-WEB

These are the source files for the internal website
that I use to teach my course [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html).
It is pretty standard Django, so you should be able to spin
up a local server on a standard Unix environment.

## Installation instructions

Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/W27XcqeXp20

### Standard Linux environment

0. [Fork the repository first](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
   if you're planning on submitting a pull request later.
1. Install the following standard tools: `python` (version 3.10), `pip`, `git`.
   (For each tool, search "[name of thing to install] [your OS]" on the web.)
2. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/otis-web`.
   Replace `USERNAME` with your username if you're forking;
   otherwise, replace with `vEnhance`.
3. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   in order to pull the `evans_django_tools` submodule.
4. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
   This enables you to use the `poetry` command;
   verify this by checking `poetry --help` produces a help message.
5. Once you have `poetry`, hit `poetry install`.
   This will automatically create a
   Python virtual environment and install stuff inside it.

   (If you are an expert familiar with Python virtual environments
   and want to use your own rather than Poetry's auto-created one,
   then you can do so by activating an environment before running
   `poetry install`.)

6. If it isn't already activated,
   [activate the Python virtual environment][activate]
   that was created in the previous step.
   The easiest way to do so is to run `poetry shell`.

   (_Note_: you have to do this step every time you start working on the
   project. That is, always run `poetry shell` before doing any work, or
   for experts, activate the virtual environment using your preferred method.)

7. If everything is working, `python manage.py check` should
   run with no errors.
8. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the local database.
9. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin user.
10. Run `python manage.py runserver`.
    The command will spin up a continuously running server.
11. Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    You should be able to log in with the user you defined in step 9.
12. The website is functional now, but it is a bit bare-bones.
    To populate it with some test data, use `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`
    or run `./fixtures/load-all.sh`.

[activate]: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#activating-the-virtual-environment

Optional steps:

- If you need to set up environment variables,
  copy `env` to `.env` and uncomment the relevant lines.
- If you want to test the Stripe stuff, a few more steps are needed.
  Briefly: install the Stripe CLI.
  Create some API keys and `stripe login`.
  Add these API keys to `.env` (the three `STRIPE_*` variables).
  Then run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payments/webhook/`.

## Pull requests

For OTIS students: pull requests welcome!
If you think the website can be improved in some way, feel free to implement it.
See [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
It's OK if you don't have much code experience; I'm willing to guide you along.
