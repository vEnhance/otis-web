  <h1>How to play Hanabi</h1>
  <p>
    If you're new to the game Hanabi, you can read the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)#Gameplay">rules on Wikipedia</a>
    or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bqSWF2DF6I">YouTube video</a>, etc.
    (This is a popular game, so searches will turn up other results.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Hanabi is a cooperative team game, so to do well, you'll need to
    discuss strategies beforehand with your team.
    Evan uses a strategy system called the <b>H-group conventions</b>,
    which you can read about on
    <a href="https://tinyurl.com/hanabi-evan-intro">Evan's intro guide</a>
    or from the comprehensive
    <a href="https://hanabi.github.io/">hanabi.github.io</a>.
    Of course, you can find or invent your own conventions too.
  </p>
  <h1>Contest Format</h1>
  <p>
    This section details specifically how OTIS-run Hanabi tournaments work
    (rather than the rules of Hanabi the game itself).
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Each contest consists of a single game of Hanabi. To join:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gather a team with the correct number of players.
          <strong>Teammates do not necessarily have to be in OTIS</strong>;
          you are welcome (encouraged?) to rope in any of your friends.
          The OTIS Discord has a channel called
          <tt>#hanabi-find-games-and-teammates</tt> as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          One player should create a table on hanab.live
          by clicking the "Start table" button above.
        </li>
        <li>
          The other players should join the table by typing
          the table password (a randomly generated 3-digit number).
        </li>
        <li>
          That's all you need to do!
          Results are scraped automatically later by the game master.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      For each contest, the random seed for the contest is fixed,
      i.e. the order the cards appear in the deck will be
      exactly the same for every game.
      Therefore, <strong>you should join at most one team per contest</strong>,
      and that team should <strong>play the seed exactly once</strong>;
      playing multiple times would break the game because you already
      know what all the cards are.
    </li>
    <li>
      We play with an honor system.
      Please follow the rules of the game and common-sense sportsmanship:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Don't spectate or look at the results of the game seed
          before you have played.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player must be a distinct human (no bots, etc.).
          Again, they do <i>not</i> need to be OTIS students or alums.
        </li>
        <li>
          No communication during the game.
          We explicitly forbid reading into the length of time a turn takes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Games are timed; the time controls are <strong>3:00+0:30</strong>.
      There are no other special settings
      (in particular, no bottom-deck blind plays).
    </li>
    <li>
      You may use any convention system you like
      (not necessarily the <a href="https://hanabi.github.io">H-group system</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      You may refer to pre-written documentation during the game,
      such as the H-group website or a dedicated Google Doc
      (as long as the document is not updated mid-game by your team, of course).
    </li>
    <li>
      Scoring for spades:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your <i>game score</i> is defined as the number of cards
          played successfully, even if you strike out or terminate the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          You earn
          \[ 4 \cdot \left( \frac{ \text{your game score} }
          { 5 \cdot \text{number of suits} } \right)^4 \]
          spades.
          For example, if you score 23/25,
          you earn $4 \cdot (23/25)^4 \approx 2.866$ spades.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition, you get +1 bonus spade if you have the
          highest nonzero game score among all participating teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition, you get an additional +1 bonus spade if you have the
          highest nonzero game score among all participating teams,
          <i>and</i> the lowest turn count among such teams.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Thus, the maximum possible spades per contest is $4+1+1=6$.
      Here, a "participating team" is any team that
      has at least one OTIS student.
    </li>
  </ol>
