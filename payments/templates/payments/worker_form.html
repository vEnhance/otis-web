      You only need to fill in a field if it matters for you;
      for example, you should leave "Zelle username" blank
      unless you actually want to be paid via Zelle.

    <h3 class="alert-heading">Payment methods</h3>
    <p>
      In order to receive payment for helping with OTIS-WEB tasks,
      you need to have at least one of the below payment methods on file.
      If you're in the United States, and happen to have access to Bank of
      America, then Zelle is probably the easiest to set up.
      Alternatively, you can opt to have the balance deducted from your invoice
      (assuming, of course, you have not already paid in full).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to work on a task even without receiving payment,
      select "pro bono" as the desired payment method after completing the
      task.
